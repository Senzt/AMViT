Dear Visitor,

Thank you for your interest in our paper on the Frequency-Based Audio Vision Transformer (FAViT) and for visiting this webpage. We are grateful for the feedback we received during INTERSPEECH 2023 in Dublin. 

We have evolved the model into the Attention Modulation Vision Transformer (AMViT), which draws further inspiration from the auditory system. We are excited to announce that AMViT will be showcased at ICASSP 2024 in South Korea.

Important Information: We apologize for the delay in releasing the code. I am transitioning into a new PhD program in Neuroscience and am also in the process of completing my previous thesis. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

Waradon
